A command line app for interacting with Salesforce API.

## Setup
Follow [this](https://blog.deadlypenguin.com/2019/03/08/jwt-bearer-auth-salesforce-node/) tutorial until its contents can be properly transferred here.

You'll need a salesforce app set up as described, and credentials for it, placed into a `credentials.js` file following the example in the root of this repo.

Proper (and uploaded) certs and credentials should allow you to run `node index.js` and get a successful response, printing the results of the query.

## Usage
